# Get started with Nordcraft

Nordcraft provides a flexible and intuitive development environment for building web applications and websites.

## Dashboard

When launching Nordcraft, you'll land on the Nordcraft dashboard.

The dashboard includes three key sections:

1. **Start building**: Quick action to start a [new project](/get-started/create-a-project) or solve challenges to explore Nordcraft features
2. **Recent activity**: Quick access to your recently edited projects
3. **All projects**: View and manage projects in your currently selected organization

## Projects in Nordcraft

A project in Nordcraft can be either an **app** or a **package**.

## Apps

Apps in Nordcraft are full web applications composed of pages, components and elements. Nordcraft is built on standard HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Anything you can build for the web, you can build with Nordcraft.

## Packages

Packages are modular, self-contained collections of components or functions that can be used across multiple apps. Packages help keep your projects organized by separating reusable elements and logic. Packages are public, allowing other users to install and integrate them into their own projects.
