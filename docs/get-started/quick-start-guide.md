# Quick Start Guide
You are about to learn a new programming language, and while that may seem overwhelming, it's not. 
Toddle is built on the web platform and adheres to the same standards. That means if you know HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, you already know toddle. 
The average time to learn toddle ranges between 2 hours for a software developer and 2 months for someone with no technical background. 

Here is how to get started: 

## Step 1: Sign Up and Create a Project

1. Go to [toddle.dev](https://toddle.dev) and sign up for an account.
2. Once logged in, click the "New Project" button.
3. Choose a template or start from scratch.
4. Give your project a name and click "Create Project".

## Step 2: Familiarize Yourself with the Editor

Take a moment to explore the Toddle editor:

- Left panel: Element tree and project structure
- Center: Canvas where you build your app
- Right panel: Properties and styling options

## Step 3: Add Elements to Your Page

1. Click the "+" button in the element tree or use the "e" hotkey to open the element catalog.
2. Choose an element (e.g., a button) and add it to your page.
3. Select the element and use the right panel to adjust its properties and styling.

## Step 4: Create Interactivity

1. Select your button element.
2. In the right panel, go to the "Events" tab.
3. Add a "Click" event and choose an action (e.g., "Show Alert").
4. Configure the action (e.g., set the alert message).

## Step 5: Preview Your App

1. Click the "Preview" button in the bottom bar to see your app in action.
2. Test the interactivity you've added.

## Step 6: Publish Your App

1. Click the "Publish" button in the bottom bar.
2. Add a description of your changes.
3. Click "Publish" to make your app live.

**Note:** Congratulations! You just published your first toddle app. From here, you can continue to add more elements, styling, and functionality to build out your application.
