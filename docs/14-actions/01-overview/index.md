description: Extend Nordcraft with custom JavaScript actions that provide global functionality, handle asynchronous operations, and integrate external libraries.

# Actions

Actions in Nordcraft are reusable JavaScript functions that allow you to extend the platform's functionality. Actions are global and can be used anywhere in your project.

Actions serve as a powerful extension mechanism in Nordcraft:

- You can write actions in JavaScript to access browser APIs
- In actions, you can import and use external libraries
- In actions, can perform asynchronous operations
- Using actions, you can create custom functionality that is not available through built-in Nordcraft features
- You can access actions globally throughout your project

::: tip
Most common tasks can be accomplished using Nordcraft's built-in formulas and workflows without writing code. Consider exploring these options before creating custom actions.

## Difference to workflows and formulas

Understanding the differences between these three concepts helps you choose the right tool:

- **Actions**: JavaScript functions that can have side effects, are globally accessible, and can perform asynchronous operations
- **Workflows**: Visual sequences of operations scoped to components or pages, designed to respond to events and have side effects
- **Formulas**: Pure functions without side effects that transform data and return consistent results for the same inputs

Actions in Nordcraft are essentially JavaScript modules with a specific entry point function, named to match the action name.

## Key characteristics of actions

### Arguments

Actions accept arguments that serve as inputs to the JavaScript function:

- Arguments are passed to the action when it is called from a workflow
- Each argument has a name and type
- Arguments provide flexibility to reuse the same action with different inputs

### Events

Actions can trigger events that call back to workflows:

- Events enable actions to communicate back to the component that called them
- An action can trigger multiple events at different times
- Events can pass data back to the workflow that will handle them

This creates a two-way communication channel between actions and workflows.

### Asynchronous execution

Actions can perform asynchronous operations:

- Use `async/await` or Promises for asynchronous code
- Trigger events after asynchronous operations complete
- Create timers, animation loops, or other time-based behaviors

### Cleanup

Actions can return a cleanup function that runs when a component unmounts:

- A cleanup function is a JavaScript function returned by your action
- This function is automatically called when the component that triggered the action is unmounted
- This is useful for clearing timers, removing event listeners, or disposing of resources
- Cleanup functions prevent memory leaks when components are removed from the page
