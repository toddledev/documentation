# Nordcraft Packages

Packages extend your project with reusable components and functionality created by the Nordcraft community. Packages save development time by providing pre-built solutions you can add to your apps.

Packages in Nordcraft work similar to NPM packages. They can contain pure logic, visual elements or both.

## Finding packages

The packages panel organizes available packages in three tabs:

- **Popular**: Most frequently installed packages
- **Newest**: Recently published packages
- **Installed**: Packages currently used in your project

Use the search bar to find specific packages by name or functionality.

## Managing packages

Once you've found packages of interest, you can add them to your project and maintain them as needed. For detailed instructions on handling packages in your project, see the [packages](/packages/overview) page and the guide on [managing packages](/packages/managing-packages).
