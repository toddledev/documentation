# Components

Components in Nordcraft allow you to create reusable and customizable building blocks for your application.

![The Nordcraft Editor is displaying card component, indicated by the pink diamond icon at the top left. The component is a card component, consisting of a number of HTML elements, and takes four attributes visible on the right panel: button label, ID, text and title.|16/9](component.webp 'Component'){https://editor.nordcraft.com/projects/docs_examples/branches/main/components/card?rightpanel=style&canvas-width=800&canvas-height=800}

Components in Nordcraft:

- Can be configured using attributes, contexts, and CSS variables, similar to HTML elements
- Can emit events to communicate with parent elements
- Contain their own element tree, which can include any other element types, including other components
- Provide consistency across your application, as updates to a component propagate to all instances
- Help encapsulate logic and design, making your application more maintainable

Components are fundamental to efficient development in Nordcraft. They should be used to:

- Create reusable design patterns
- Encapsulate complex functionality
- Divide large interfaces into more manageable parts
- Ensure consistency throughout your application
