# Export a component

Components built in Nordcraft can be exported as standard web components, allowing you to use them in other projects and frameworks outside of Nordcraft.

## Export as web component

![Export a component|16/9](export-a-component.webp){https://editor.nordcraft.com/projects/docs_examples/branches/main/components/card?canvas-width=800&rightpanel=style&canvas-height=800}

To export a component from Nordcraft:

1. Open the component you want to export in the editor
2. In the [bottom bar](/the-editor/bottom-bar), click the [kbd]Export as web component[kbd] icon button
3. Set the default attributes
4. Copy the HTML code snippet for this web component

::: tip
For production use, always export your component from the `main` branch.

Components in Nordcraft are built on the **Web Component API**, which means:

- They work in all modern browsers
- No compilation, custom build steps, or plugins are required
- They can be used directly in any HTML page or JavaScript framework

::: info
Web Components enable custom, reusable HTML elements. See the [MDN Web Components documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components) for details.

::: warning
Proxied API requests will not work for embedded web components. They will only work for applications hosted by Nordcraft. [Learn more about proxied API requests](/connecting-data/advanced-api-features#proxy-request) in Nordcraft.

## Component naming requirements

Components in Nordcraft follow the naming restrictions of web components:

- Component names must contain at least two parts separated by a hyphen `-` (e.g., `user-card` or `nav-item`); this follows web component naming conventions
- If a component name has only one part (e.g. "item"), Nordcraft will automatically prefix it with `nordcraft` (resulting in `nordcraft-item`)
- Component names cannot contain any special characters
- Names are case-sensitive, but best practice is to use lowercase for compatibility
