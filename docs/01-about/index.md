# What is Nordcraft?

Nordcraft is an open-source **Web Development Engine** that combines visual design tools, a front-end framework built on web standards, and full programming capabilities in a single platform.

## Who is Nordcraft for?

Nordcraft is for **web designers** who want to deliver great experiences to their users.

If youâ€™re using Nordcraft in a product team, you get to skip that traditional handover process from design to development. Using Nordcraft as a web designer, you can build web applications as you design the UI, while the engineers in your team can focus on building out the business logic and the back end.

## Unifying design and development

Nordcraft combines a visual editor for user interface design with a powerful technical foundation built on modern web standards, accelerating development of your websites and web applications without sacrificing quality or control.

Key features include:

- Visual editing of UI components familiar to designers working in Figma
- Component-based architecture similar to React, Vue, and Svelte front-end frameworks
- Visual development environment for implementing interactive behavior and application logic
- Branch-based environment for parallel feature development and team collaboration
